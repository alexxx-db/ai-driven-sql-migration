# (Windows) Installing the Usage Collection Scheduler

## Prerequisites

The following requirements must be met before running the profiler scheduler installer:
1. Python 3.10 (or higher)
3. Administrator access to the Windows Task Manager
4. Cloned copy of the `remorph` project

## Running the installer

The installer will create and register a new Windows system task:

- **usage_collection_task.xml** - A task file that describes the remorph profiler as a system service (see **Description of the task file elements** section below)

### Installation steps:

1. Open a new CMD window and navigate to the scheduler directory:

```bash
> cd $HOME\\.databricks\\labs\\remorph\\assessments\\scheduler\\install\\
```

2. Run the installer script:

```bash
> python3 install.py
```

### Un-installation steps:

1. Open a new CMD window and navigate to the scheduler directory:

```bash
> cd $HOME\\.databricks\\labs\\remorph\\assessments\\scheduler\\install\\
```

2. Run the uninstaller script:

```bash
> python3 uninstall.py
```

## Description of the task file elements

1. **Triggers**: Specifies the frequency for when the profiler should run

2. **StartBoundary**: Defines the initial start time of the profiler scheduler

3. **Principals**: Defines under who's identity the task will execute and with what privileges

4. **Settings**: Specifies the profiler behavior during common system conditions

5. **Actions**: Defines how to execute the profiler program
